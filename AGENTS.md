# Tool Rules (compose-agentsmd)

- `compose-agentsmd` intentionally regenerates `AGENTS.md`; any resulting `AGENTS.md` diff is expected and must not be treated as an unexpected external change.
- If `compose-agentsmd` is not available, run it via `npx compose-agentsmd`. If `npx` is unavailable or cannot fetch the package, install it via npm with an environment-appropriate method such as `npm install -g compose-agentsmd` when global installs are permitted, or a user-local npm prefix when global installs are not permitted.
- To update shared/global rules, use `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` to locate the writable rules workspace, make changes only in that workspace, then run `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` (do not manually clone or edit the rules source repo outside this workflow).
- If you find an existing clone of the rules source repo elsewhere, do not assume it is the correct rules workspace; always treat `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` output as the source of truth.
- `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` pushes each GitHub source workspace when its workspace is clean, then regenerates instruction files with refreshed rules.
- Do not edit `AGENTS.md` directly; update the source rules and regenerate.
- `tools/tool-rules.md` is the shared rule source for all repositories that use compose-agentsmd.
- Before applying any rule updates, present the planned changes first with an ANSI-colored diff-style preview, ask for explicit approval, then make the edits.
- These tool rules live in tools/tool-rules.md in the compose-agentsmd repository; do not duplicate them in other rule modules.

# Course Teaching Purpose

- Treat the terminal goal of every course as: by graduation, the learner can, with confidence, build the things they want or need, on their own.
- Evaluate course content, sequencing, exercises, lesson structure, quizzes, and exams against that goal.
- Treat the learner's own happiness as the highest-level goal this purpose ultimately serves.
- Apply this purpose to every course, even when time or session count is insufficient to fully reach it.

# Educational Question Authoring

## Scientific foundations

- Apply Cognitive Load Theory: reduce extraneous load by making prompts
  self-contained, explicit, and free of source-document references.
- Apply retrieval practice and the testing effect: questions should require
  learners to recall, explain, or apply taught knowledge, not merely recognize
  classroom events.
- Apply transfer-appropriate processing: questions should assess concepts,
  procedures, judgments, debugging cues, or misconceptions in reusable contexts.
- Apply formative feedback principles: explanations should help learners repair
  misconceptions at their current level, not merely reveal the answer.

- Educational questions MUST align with the intended learning target, learner
  level, and already-taught scope.
- Each question MUST focus on one concept, skill, judgment, or misconception.
- Prompts MUST be answerable from the question context without relying on
  hidden classroom-event memory.
- Prompts, answers, and explanations MUST stand alone without referring to
  "this material", "the attached document", "lesson N", or other external
  source context unless that source context is included in the prompt itself.
- Educational questions MUST NOT assess content or context specific to a
  particular teaching material, example, exercise, project, story, or classroom
  activity. Use source materials only to establish the taught scope and
  evidence. Rewrite assessment targets as self-contained, transferable
  concepts, features, roles, procedures, judgments, debugging cues, or
  misconceptions that remain valid outside the original teaching artifact.
- Unless an identifier or value is itself an intended learning target,
  questions MUST NOT make recall of incidental source-specific names or values
  part of the answer. This includes work titles, scenarios, characters,
  Blueprint names, class names, function names, variable names, level names,
  file names, message strings, instructor-assigned labels, example-specific
  constants, placements, and outputs. Replace them with generic role-based
  wording while preserving the taught technical distinction.
- Questions, prompts, options, answers, scoring criteria, and explanations MUST NOT introduce, require, or casually reference untaught concepts, features, parameters, APIs, syntax, techniques, tools, or extension-only content unless the user explicitly requests extension-level assessment.
- Scoring criteria (also called rubric criteria) are the individual bullet items of a question's `## Scoring` section, each describing one thing the answer must demonstrate.
- The number of scoring criteria and their ordering determine the assessment manifest `points` array: the `points` length MUST equal the criterion count, and each `points` entry maps to the criterion at the same index.
- Questions MUST have a single defensible answer, or explicitly state the
  accepted answer range.
- Multiple-choice distractors MUST be plausible, close to the correct answer,
  and based on likely misconceptions or mistakes.
- Each multiple-choice distractor MUST differ from the correct answer by one
  meaningful concept, target, condition, order, or effect.
- Multiple-choice distractors MUST NOT be obviously unrelated options from a
  different feature area when the question assesses specific technical
  understanding.
- For technical workflow questions, multiple-choice distractors SHOULD remain
  within the same tool, editor, panel, node family, command family, or
  operation category as the correct answer.
- Multiple-choice distractors MAY be obviously wrong only when the learning
  objective is basic vocabulary recognition for first exposure.
- Fill-in questions MUST specify the expected answer format and any forbidden or
  equivalent answers when ambiguity is likely.
- Explanations MUST state the reasoning, concept, procedure, or misconception
  behind the answer.
- Explanations for novice learners MUST be instructional rather than answer-key
  only: include enough reasoning for the learner to repair the misconception.
- When authoring a short question set, order items from lower intrinsic load to
  higher intrinsic load and cover multiple important taught targets rather than
  repeating one surface pattern.

# Course Docs Authoring

- Course documentation content MUST be written for beginner learners in clear
  Japanese unless the task explicitly requests another language.
- Use shared `course-docs-platform` MDX components for page structure, learner
  actions, explanations, checks, exercises, answers, references, and recovery
  support.
- Common components include `<Section>`, `<Action>`, `<Concept>`, `<Reference>`,
  `<Verify>`, `<QuickCheck>`, `<Checkpoint>`, `<Exercise>`, `<Evidence>`,
  `<Hint>`, `<Answer>`, and `<Recovery>`. `<Instruction>` and `<ProblemSolving>`
  are Learning System stage markers, not general-purpose containers.
- A top-level `<Section>` MUST declare `goal`.
- Learner-facing HTML examples MUST use normal HTML void elements without
  XHTML-style trailing slashes, such as `<input>` rather than `<input />`. This
  applies to HTML code fences and sample/complete files, not MDX/JSX components.
- Course docs MUST NOT use `<Solution>` or `authoringMode`.

## Learning System contract

- A Learning Unit is a canonical objective or capability with a stable ID.
  Define each Unit exactly once in the course-root `learning-units.yaml`; do not
  duplicate its `objective` in MDX.
- Units MAY have parent-child hierarchy. The platform derives Composite status
  for Units with children and Leaf status for Units without children. A
  Composite MAY have no direct Event; each Leaf MUST have Learning Event
  coverage.
- A Learning Event is one occurrence of how the learner learns targeted Units.
  Represent it with metadata on an existing `<Section>`. One Event MUST be
  contained in one MDX page; do not reuse an Event ID across pages or nest
  Event-bearing Sections.
- A Page is a display/distribution unit, not a Learning Unit. Derive course
  progression from the ordered Learning Events; do not maintain a separate
  Learning Plan or teacher lesson graph.
- Event metadata uses `eventId`, `targets`, and `phase`; `pattern` is required
  only for an initial Event. `strategy="productive-failure"` is optional and
  valid only for an initial, problem-solving-first Event.
- Valid `phase` values are `initial`, `practice`, `retrieval`, and `transfer`.
  Initial Events MUST set `pattern` to `instruction-first` or
  `problem-solving-first`; non-initial Events MUST NOT set `pattern`.
- Initial Events MUST use `<Instruction>` and `<ProblemSolving>` as explicit
  stage markers, each as a direct child of the Event Section. Markers MUST NOT
  appear outside an initial Event, inside non-initial Events, or nest inside one
  another.
- Order the stage markers to match `pattern`: Instruction before ProblemSolving
  for `instruction-first`, and ProblemSolving before Instruction for
  `problem-solving-first`.
- Do not treat Productive Failure as another name for problem-solving-first.
  Follow the platform metadata contract without inventing an agent-side semantic
  test for whether an Event qualifies.

## Tasks, evidence, and closure

- Exercise and QuickCheck tasks MUST present the problem, then one or more
  `<Hint>` blocks, then exactly one `<Answer>` block. Hints MUST NOT reveal the
  answer first and MUST use material already covered in this or a guaranteed
  earlier lesson. Answers MUST explain why they are correct and address a likely
  misconception only when one genuinely exists.
- Exercise is a task/container format, not a learning phase. Near-copy and
  routine application tasks MAY use `<Exercise>`; the component name alone does
  not make a task transfer.
- In Learning System content, bind objective evidence with metadata-only
  `<Evidence>` around an existing learner-facing surface when an explicit
  evidence mapping is needed. Allowed surfaces are `<Verify>`, `<QuickCheck>`,
  `<Checkpoint>`, and `<Exercise>`; `demonstrates` is `application`,
  `retrieval`, or `transfer`.
- Do not infer evidence kind from a component name. `<Recovery>` is not an
  Evidence surface. `<Evidence>` supplies a binding; it is not assessment UI.
- A transfer task MUST require selecting and adapting a learned principle under
  different conditions. Changing only values, names, or materials in a near-copy
  is not transfer.
- Each substantive learning goal MUST have an aligned closure that can test it.
  Choose closure based on needed evidence: `<Verify>` for observable state,
  `<QuickCheck>` for retrieval or understanding, `<Checkpoint>` for a
  multi-condition milestone, or `<Exercise>` for application or transfer tasks.
  This is a selection guide; component type alone does not determine evidence
  kind.
- Immediate success shows current performance, not durable mastery. Later
  recurrence alone does not establish distributed practice. Do not model spacing
  or interleaving as a single Event attribute.
- `<Recovery>` supports error diagnosis and recovery; it is not learning-goal
  closure. The platform currently reports missing explicit objective evidence as
  a note; do not describe that note as an enforced build failure.
- Do not impose a fixed page-wide order for QuickCheck, Exercise, and extension
  exercises; place tasks where they support the learner's progression.
- Exercise headings MUST use `### 演習N` for standard exercises and `### 演習-発展N`
  for extension exercises. Exercise statements MUST give the expected result,
  success criteria, and enough context to start without guessing. Extension
  exercises MUST be optional and not required for base lesson completion.

## Learner-facing explanations and guidance

- Introduce concepts when the learner needs them. A `<Concept>` MUST focus on
  one concept and include only information needed for imminent first use. First
  use MAY be an Action, Section, Verify, QuickCheck, or Exercise. Roughly 2–5
  sentences or one short table is preferred; 6+ sentences SHOULD trigger review
  for multiple concepts or reference material, not automatic rejection.
- Write so a learner reading once from the top can understand each idea without
  backtracking: establish the need or context, name and explain the concept,
  then use it (`Need / Context → Name + meaning → Use`). Do not rely on an
  unexplained concept as already known.
- A new term may first appear in a heading or title; its name alone does not
  introduce the concept. When first named there, the heading/title and its
  immediately following explanation MUST work together to make the meaning
  explicit before the learner is expected to use it. Do not assume the learner
  already knows the term. Prefer `Need / Context → Name + meaning → Use` while
  allowing the name to appear before its explanation. Do not require a glossary
  or predefine every term.
- Exact literal values, identifiers, and metaphors may appear before their
  meaning is explained; explain them before relying on the learner to know what
  they mean. Judge cold-read clarity by whether a learner reading downward from
  the start can understand the current material without going back, not by
  whether every string appeared only after a prior definition.
- Introduce only concepts and elements learners will use or engage with; do not
  add later-use realism without a learning need.
- Before choosing representation or assistance, identify whether the intended
  goal is initial performance, learning (including retention), transfer, or a
  deliberate combination. Do not optimize only initial performance when
  learning or transfer is an explicit goal.
- Choose the most efficient primary representation for the task and goal: visual
  for spatial UI/layout information, code or CodePreview for code authoring,
  text for short non-spatial operations, and diagrams/visuals for structural
  relationships. Do not add images merely because a step is operational.
- Treat one `<Action>` as one coherent learner action episode toward an
  immediate sub-goal. It MAY contain a short, locally unified sequence (for
  example, click → open menu → hover → choose) when splitting each click would
  increase integration cost.
- Do not duplicate a complete procedure across primary representation and prose
  merely for repetition. Short labels, identifiers, numbers, positional cues,
  and exact values MAY appear in both when they reduce search or integration
  cost.
- An `<Action>` MUST be executable without guessing. For a visual-primary
  Action, prose MAY add complementary details instead of repeating the full
  visual path, provided essential visual instructions have a complete accessible
  text-equivalent route.
- Preserve accessibility-equivalent instructions; avoid competing duplicate
  paths when the platform can expose an equivalent accessibly or on demand.
- For a new procedure with low or unestablished prior knowledge, provide enough
  worked or guided support before substantial independent construction. Fade,
  retain, or restore assistance based on established prior knowledge and learner
  performance; do not use a fixed second-time/third-time rule.
- Learner-facing prose MUST NOT contain author-facing audience descriptions such
  as `受講者は〜`, `学習者は〜`, or `初学者向け` when they do not help perform the task.
  Rewrite these as direct task prose. Do not ban `ユーザー` when it refers to a real
  product/domain end user rather than the tutorial reader.
- Informative tutorial visuals MUST have text alternatives appropriate to their
  role. For complex annotated screenshots or diagrams, use short `alt` text for
  purpose/identity and put the detailed equivalent in adjacent learner-visible
  text or another long-description mechanism.
- Screenshot annotation text and images of text MUST meet WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.3
  contrast: 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Meaningful non-text
  callout shapes and UI-state indicators MUST meet the applicable 3:1 non-text
  contrast requirement. Prefer real text over images of text when practical.

# Course Docs Repository and Site Architecture

- `metyatech/course-docs-site` is the Course Docs monorepo and the only runnable
  Next.js/Nextra course site app. The runnable site remains at the repository
  root.
- `packages/platform` is the internal workspace package named
  `@metyatech/course-docs-platform`.
- The monorepo MUST keep a single root `package-lock.json`; workspace packages
  MUST NOT contain their own lockfiles.
- `packages/platform` owns shared MDX components, remark/rehype configuration,
  webpack asset rules, reusable Next app factories/routes, and shared
  course-site behavior.
- The root site owns content synchronization, site composition, deployment
  wiring, development tooling, and end-to-end tests. Root site code MUST remain
  composition/wiring for platform-owned behavior.
- Shared behavior that applies to multiple courses belongs in
  `packages/platform`.
- Site/platform cross-boundary changes MUST be committed and verified atomically
  in the same repository. Platform, site, course build, and end-to-end
  verification MUST run together for changes crossing this boundary.
- The archived `metyatech/course-docs-platform` repository is historical only.
  Active code MUST NOT depend on it through Git, GitHub SHA dependencies,
  submodules, or subtree synchronization.

## Course content repositories

- Course content repositories are content-only. They MAY contain `content/**`,
  static assets such as `public/img/**`, `site.config.ts`, and course-specific
  data such as `learning-units.yaml`.
- `learning-units.yaml` MUST be at the course root when used. It is the
  canonical course-specific Learning Unit/objective model, not site or runtime
  implementation. Require it when MDX uses Learning System Event metadata or
  components such as `<Evidence>`; do not require it for legacy content that has
  not adopted the Learning System.
- Course content repositories MUST NOT add Next.js/Nextra app runtime files such
  as `next.config.js`, `src/app`, app package files, or site runtime
  implementations.
- `public/img/favicon.ico` is expected by `site.config.ts` when `faviconHref`
  references it. Framework boilerplate assets MUST NOT be kept unless referenced
  by content.
- Secrets MUST NOT be stored in course content repositories. `.env.local` is
  local-only and belongs in `course-docs-site`, not in content repositories.
- Preview course content through `course-docs-site` by setting
  `COURSE_CONTENT_SOURCE`.
- Vercel deployment for course sites MUST use GitHub Actions with the Vercel
  CLI, not Vercel's GitHub integration.

## Course structure and navigation

- A Page is a display/distribution unit, not a pedagogical Learning Unit.
  Learning Event order is the source for actual course material progression; do
  not treat a page, Nextra navigation entry, or file path as a Learning Unit or
  substitute it for Event order.
- Course Docs MAY use Nextra navigation order where it represents material
  progression. If navigation order is incomplete, progression may be uncertain;
  a path-based fallback MUST NOT be described as lesson order.
- Do not require a separate session plan or teacher lesson graph when Learning
  Events already express progression.
- Generic tool-agnostic specs MUST remain in their dedicated repositories.
  Course Docs Site-specific presentation conventions belong in
  `course-docs-platform` or the `course-docs` domain, not generic specs.
- Course docs pages MUST define page titles in frontmatter.
- `_meta.ts` MUST be used for grouping-only folder labels, not for overriding
  ordinary page titles.
- Default sidebar collapse behavior MUST be controlled through
  `theme.config.tsx` sidebar settings. `theme.collapsed` MUST be used only for
  true exceptions.
