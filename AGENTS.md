# Tool Rules (compose-agentsmd)

- **Session gate**: before starting substantive work for each externally supplied human/operator instruction, run `compose-agentsmd` once from the project root. AGENTS.md contains the rules you operate under; stale rules cause rule violations. Do not rerun this gate within the same instruction after tool results, retries, generated continuations, or resumed execution. If you discover you skipped this step mid-session, stop, run it immediately, re-read the diff, and adjust your behavior before continuing.
- `compose-agentsmd` intentionally regenerates `AGENTS.md`; any resulting `AGENTS.md` diff is expected and must not be treated as an unexpected external change.
- If `compose-agentsmd` is not available, run it via `npx compose-agentsmd`. If `npx` is unavailable or cannot fetch the package, install it via npm with an environment-appropriate method such as `npm install -g compose-agentsmd` when global installs are permitted, or a user-local npm prefix when global installs are not permitted.
- To update shared/global rules, use `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` to locate the writable rules workspace, make changes only in that workspace, then run `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` (do not manually clone or edit the rules source repo outside this workflow).
- If you find an existing clone of the rules source repo elsewhere, do not assume it is the correct rules workspace; always treat `compose-agentsmd edit-rules` output as the source of truth.
- `compose-agentsmd apply-rules` pushes each GitHub source workspace when its workspace is clean, then regenerates instruction files with refreshed rules.
- Do not edit `AGENTS.md` directly; update the source rules and regenerate.
- `tools/tool-rules.md` is the shared rule source for all repositories that use compose-agentsmd.
- Before applying any rule updates, present the planned changes first with an ANSI-colored diff-style preview, ask for explicit approval, then make the edits.
- These tool rules live in tools/tool-rules.md in the compose-agentsmd repository; do not duplicate them in other rule modules.

# Course Teaching Purpose

- Treat the terminal goal of every course as: by graduation, the learner can, with confidence, build the things they want or need, on their own.
- Evaluate course content, sequencing, exercises, lesson structure, quizzes, and exams against that goal.
- Treat the learner's own happiness as the highest-level goal this purpose ultimately serves.
- Apply this purpose to every course, even when time or session count is insufficient to fully reach it.

# Educational Question Authoring

## Scientific foundations

- Apply Cognitive Load Theory: reduce extraneous load by making prompts
  self-contained, explicit, and free of source-document references.
- Apply retrieval practice and the testing effect: questions should require
  learners to recall, explain, or apply taught knowledge, not merely recognize
  classroom events.
- Apply transfer-appropriate processing: questions should assess concepts,
  procedures, judgments, debugging cues, or misconceptions in reusable contexts.
- Apply formative feedback principles: explanations should help learners repair
  misconceptions at their current level, not merely reveal the answer.

- Educational questions MUST align with the intended learning target, learner
  level, and already-taught scope.
- Each question MUST focus on one concept, skill, judgment, or misconception.
- Prompts MUST be answerable from the question context without relying on
  hidden classroom-event memory.
- Prompts, answers, and explanations MUST stand alone without referring to
  "this material", "the attached document", "lesson N", or other external
  source context unless that source context is included in the prompt itself.
- Educational questions MUST NOT assess content or context specific to a
  particular teaching material, example, exercise, project, story, or classroom
  activity. Use source materials only to establish the taught scope and
  evidence. Rewrite assessment targets as self-contained, transferable
  concepts, features, roles, procedures, judgments, debugging cues, or
  misconceptions that remain valid outside the original teaching artifact.
- Unless an identifier or value is itself an intended learning target,
  questions MUST NOT make recall of incidental source-specific names or values
  part of the answer. This includes work titles, scenarios, characters,
  Blueprint names, class names, function names, variable names, level names,
  file names, message strings, instructor-assigned labels, example-specific
  constants, placements, and outputs. Replace them with generic role-based
  wording while preserving the taught technical distinction.
- Questions, prompts, options, answers, scoring criteria, and explanations MUST NOT introduce, require, or casually reference untaught concepts, features, parameters, APIs, syntax, techniques, tools, or extension-only content unless the user explicitly requests extension-level assessment.
- Scoring criteria (also called rubric criteria) are the individual bullet items of a question's `## Scoring` section, each describing one thing the answer must demonstrate.
- The number of scoring criteria and their ordering determine the assessment manifest `points` array: the `points` length MUST equal the criterion count, and each `points` entry maps to the criterion at the same index.
- Questions MUST have a single defensible answer, or explicitly state the
  accepted answer range.
- Multiple-choice distractors MUST be plausible, close to the correct answer,
  and based on likely misconceptions or mistakes.
- Each multiple-choice distractor MUST differ from the correct answer by one
  meaningful concept, target, condition, order, or effect.
- Multiple-choice distractors MUST NOT be obviously unrelated options from a
  different feature area when the question assesses specific technical
  understanding.
- For technical workflow questions, multiple-choice distractors SHOULD remain
  within the same tool, editor, panel, node family, command family, or
  operation category as the correct answer.
- Multiple-choice distractors MAY be obviously wrong only when the learning
  objective is basic vocabulary recognition for first exposure.
- Fill-in questions MUST specify the expected answer format and any forbidden or
  equivalent answers when ambiguity is likely.
- Explanations MUST state the reasoning, concept, procedure, or misconception
  behind the answer.
- Explanations for novice learners MUST be instructional rather than answer-key
  only: include enough reasoning for the learner to repair the misconception.
- When authoring a short question set, order items from lower intrinsic load to
  higher intrinsic load and cover multiple important taught targets rather than
  repeating one surface pattern.

# Course Docs Authoring

- Course documentation content MUST be written for beginner learners in clear Japanese unless the task explicitly requests another language.
- Course docs pages MUST use the shared course-docs MDX components when they express page structure, learner actions, verification, concept explanation, reference material, recovery steps, checkpoints, exercises, or answers.
- Use `<Section>`, `<Action>`, `<Verify>`, `<Concept>`, `<Reference>`, `<Recovery>`, `<Checkpoint>`, `<Exercise>`, `<QuickCheck>`, `<Hint>`, and `<Answer>` from `course-docs-platform` for structured tutorial pages.
- A top-level `<Section>` MUST declare `goal`.
- Learner-facing HTML examples MUST use normal HTML void elements without XHTML-style trailing slashes, such as `<input>` rather than `<input />`.
- The void-element rule applies to learner-facing HTML code fences and sample/complete files; it does not apply to MDX/JSX component syntax.
- Exercises MUST use `<Exercise>`, `<Hint>`, and `<Answer>` when the page expects learners to attempt a task and then compare with an answer.
- QuickCheck tasks MUST use `<QuickCheck>`, `<Hint>`, and `<Answer>` when the page expects learners to check understanding and then compare with an answer.
- Every `<Exercise>` and `<QuickCheck>` task MUST be structured as problem content, followed by one or more `<Hint>` blocks, followed by exactly one `<Answer>` block.
- A `<Hint>` MUST NOT reveal the answer first and MUST use only material already covered earlier in the same lesson or in a guaranteed earlier lesson.
- An `<Answer>` MUST provide enough explanation to make the feedback instructive, not only the final answer. Explain why the answer is correct and address a likely misconception when one genuinely exists; do not invent a misconception merely to satisfy the template.
- Course docs MUST NOT use `<Solution>` or `authoringMode`.
- Course docs MUST NOT impose a fixed page-wide order for QuickCheck, Exercise, and extension exercise blocks; place each task where it best supports the learner's progression.
- Exercise headings MUST use `### 演習N` for standard exercises and `### 演習-発展N` for extension exercises.
- Exercise statements MUST include the expected result, success criteria, and enough context for learners to start without guessing.
- Extension exercises MUST be optional and must not be required for the base lesson completion.

## Tutorial representation and learning-goal closure

- Before choosing representation or assistance, identify whether the lesson/section is intended mainly for immediate task performance, later retention, transfer, or a deliberate combination. Do not optimise only first-attempt speed when retention or transfer is an explicit goal.
- For each learner action, choose the most efficient primary representation for both the task and intended instructional horizon: visual for spatial UI/layout information, code or CodePreview for code authoring, text for short non-spatial operations, and diagrams/visuals for structural relationships. Images MUST NOT be added merely because a step is operational.
- Treat one `<Action>` as one coherent learner action episode toward an immediate sub-goal. It MAY contain a short locally unified sequence (for example, click → open menu → hover → choose) when splitting per click would increase rather than reduce integration cost.
- Do not duplicate the same complete procedure across the primary representation and secondary prose merely for repetition. Short labels, identifiers, numbers, positional cues, exact values, or other mapping information MAY appear in both when they materially reduce search/integration cost.
- The `<Action>` as a whole MUST be executable without guessing. For a visual-primary Action, visible prose MAY contain only complementary information rather than restating the full visual path, provided a complete accessible text-equivalent route exists for essential visual instructions.
- Accessibility-equivalent instructions MUST NOT be removed as “redundancy”. Preserve a complete text-equivalent route for essential visual information while avoiding two unnecessarily competing primary paths when the platform can expose the equivalent accessibly or on demand.
- A substantive learning goal MUST have an aligned closure that can actually test that goal. Use `<Verify>` for observable behavior/state, `<QuickCheck>` for retrieval/understanding, `<Checkpoint>` for a meaningful multi-condition milestone, or `<Exercise>` for transfer/application. Do not add every closure component mechanically.
- Treat immediate closure as evidence of current performance, not proof of durable mastery. Important knowledge SHOULD be revisited later through retrieval/distributed practice when curriculum scope allows; do not claim permanent mastery from one immediate success.
- `<Recovery>` is error diagnosis/recovery support and MUST NOT be treated as learning-goal closure.
- A `<Concept>` MUST focus on one new concept and only the information needed for imminent first use. First use MAY be an Action, Section, Verify, QuickCheck, or Exercise as appropriate. Roughly 2–5 sentences or one short table is preferred; 6+ sentences SHOULD trigger review for multiple concepts or reference material, not automatic rejection.
- For a new procedure with low or unestablished prior knowledge, show enough worked/guided support before substantial independent construction. Fade, retain, or restore assistance based on established prior knowledge and learner performance; do not use a fixed "second time / third time" phase rule.
- Learner-facing prose MUST NOT contain author-facing audience meta descriptions such as `受講者は〜`, `学習者は〜`, or `初学者向け` when they do not help perform the task. Rewrite them as direct task prose. Do not ban `ユーザー` when it refers to a real product/domain end user rather than the tutorial reader.
- All informative tutorial visuals MUST have text alternatives appropriate to their role. For complex annotated screenshots / diagrams, use short `alt` text for purpose/identity and put the detailed equivalent in adjacent learner-visible text or another long-description mechanism instead of cramming the whole procedure into `alt`.
- For screenshot annotations, normal text and images of text MUST meet WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.3 contrast of at least 4.5:1; large text may use 3:1. Meaningful non-text callout shapes and UI-state indicators MUST meet the applicable 3:1 non-text contrast requirement. Prefer real text over images of text when practical.

## Beginner lesson material ordering

- Materials MUST pass a literal cold-read in natural rendered order: if a learner reads linearly from the first word onward, every dependency must be understandable at first use. This is a verification method, not an assumption that real learners will read every word or never re-enter the page midstream.
- Design for scanning/re-entry as well as linear correctness: major headings/goals SHOULD orient a returning reader, and sequential dependencies MUST be explicit rather than inferred.
- At any point in the material, do not introduce a term or feature that has not been explained earlier in that same material (or in a strictly earlier lesson within the same course, when curriculum ordering guarantees it was already taught). Introduce new terms or features at the point where learners first need them.
- "Term or feature" is not limited to HTML/CSS/JS syntax or APIs. It also includes: quoted literal values used in prose or tables (e.g. a string like `active` used as a rule's classification key), variable/identifier names, and any word or metaphor used in a `<Section>`/`<Concept>`/heading title or in body prose, a table cell, or a bullet, before its meaning has been established.
- A `<Concept>` or `<Section>` title MUST NOT rely on a word, abbreviation, or metaphor that is only explained in that block's own body or in a later block. Titles MUST either be self-explanatory to a reader who has not yet read the body, or be phrased so the metaphor/label appears only after the body has explained the underlying idea (e.g. as a closing summary label, not as the heading itself).
- When a rule, table, or summary statement needs to reference a specific value, label, or term (e.g. a classification-rule sentence naming a value to count), the term MUST already be defined by that point, or the sentence MUST explicitly flag it as forthcoming rather than using it as if already known.
- When creating materials, first decide how learners should behave in each section, then write the content so that it naturally leads them to behave that way.
- Introduce only one new concept or element at a time.
- Do not include elements, such as terms, features, code, or markup, that learners will not use or engage with just because they might be realistic or useful later.

### Verification method for this rule

- Checking this rule requires a literal top-to-bottom "cold read" simulation, not a structural/component-level scan. To review material against this rule:
  1. Walk the material from the first word to the last, in rendered reading order, including titles/headings (which render before their own body).
  2. Maintain a running set of terms, values, and metaphors that have been explicitly explained so far.
  3. At each sentence, heading, table cell, and code comment, check every technical term, quoted value, and metaphor against that running set before accepting it as understandable at that point.
  4. Flag the first point where a word could not be resolved by a first-time reader using only what has been read so far. Headings/titles MUST be checked against content read strictly before that heading, never against the body that follows it.
- A structural check (e.g. "does this page use the required MDX components", "is `goal` present") does NOT satisfy this rule's verification requirement and MUST NOT be treated as a substitute for the cold-read simulation above.

# Course Docs Repository and Site Architecture

- `metyatech/course-docs-site` is the Course Docs monorepo and the only runnable Next.js/Nextra course site app.
- The runnable site remains at the repository root.
- `packages/platform` is the internal workspace package named `@metyatech/course-docs-platform`.
- The Course Docs monorepo MUST keep a single root `package-lock.json`; workspace packages MUST NOT contain their own lockfiles.
- `packages/platform` owns shared MDX components, remark/rehype configuration, webpack asset rules, reusable Next app factories/routes, and shared course-site behavior.
- The root site owns content synchronization, site composition, deployment wiring, development tooling, and end-to-end tests.
- Shared behavior that applies to multiple courses belongs in `packages/platform`.
- Root site code MUST remain composition/wiring for platform-owned behavior.
- Site/platform cross-boundary changes MUST be committed and verified atomically in the same repository.
- Platform, site, course build, and end-to-end verification MUST run together for changes that cross the site/platform boundary.
- The archived `metyatech/course-docs-platform` repository is historical only.
- Active code MUST NOT depend on the archived repository through Git, GitHub SHA dependencies, submodules, or subtree synchronization.
- Content repositories remain content-only repositories.
- Course content repositories MUST keep only course content, static assets, and course-specific configuration such as `content/**`, `public/img/**`, and `site.config.ts`.
- Course content repositories MUST NOT add Next.js/Nextra app runtime files such as `next.config.js`, `src/app`, app package files, or site runtime implementations.
- `public/img/favicon.ico` is expected by `site.config.ts` when `faviconHref` references it.
- Framework boilerplate assets MUST NOT be kept unless referenced by content.
- Secrets MUST NOT be stored in course content repositories.
- `.env.local` is local-only and belongs in `course-docs-site`, not in content repositories.
- Course content MUST be previewed through `course-docs-site` by setting `COURSE_CONTENT_SOURCE`.
- Vercel deployment for course sites MUST use GitHub Actions with the Vercel CLI, not Vercel's GitHub integration.
- Generic tool-agnostic specs MUST remain in their dedicated repositories.
- Course Docs Site-specific presentation conventions MUST be documented in `course-docs-platform` or the `course-docs` domain, not in generic specs.
- Course docs pages MUST define page titles in frontmatter.
- `_meta.ts` MUST be used for grouping-only folder labels, not for overriding ordinary page titles.
- Default sidebar collapse behavior MUST be controlled through `theme.config.tsx` sidebar settings.
